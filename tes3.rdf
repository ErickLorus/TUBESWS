        Featuring a recurring sample of Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068”, “The Good Part” focuses on the desire to skip to the best part of one’s life.

        In an interview with Zach Sang in August 2017, the band revealed that this song was the only track on the album that wasn’t written in their living room:
        
        That was done in the back of Ingrid Michaelson’s tour bus because we were opening for her when we first started writing.

The more I’ve played it live, the more I’ve made it more my own and people seem to really connect with it and really enjoy it so I’m excited to see how that song’s going to do.    </music:summary>

        “The Nights” by Avicii is an ode to good fun and also to the singer’s father. The “pirate-y fight” (as described by the writer Nicholas Furlong) sound to the song was inspired by the bars in Ireland, where they play folk music which is upbeat and easy to dance (and drink) to.

In another aspect, the song is also seen as a narrative on the French Revolution given the historical and biblical references in the lyrics. The instrumental is based around a string and piano background, led by an orchestral drum beat.

        “You’re Gonna Live Forever In Me” holds the promise of a legacy. John considers the impact that a special person has had on his life, claiming that “parts of [him] were made by [them].”
        John’s personality is a product of the subject’s companionship, and John promises that influence will never die. In between a whistling intro and outro, Mayer invokes images of mass-extinction and “destiny” to prove his commitment.
        The track was included in the first batch of songs released off the album, alongside “Moving On And Getting Over,” “Changing” and “Love On The Weekend.” The album was released in sets of four tracks – sets which were released monthly.

    Bohemian Rhapsody is a song by the British rock band Queen from their fourth album, A Night at the Opera (1975). Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, the song is a six-minute suite, notable for its lack of a refraining chorus and consisting of several sections: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. It is one of the few progressive rock songs of the 1970s to achieve widespread commercial success and appeal to a mainstream audience. Mercury referred to "Bohemian Rhapsody" as a "mock opera" that resulted from the combination of three songs he had written. It was recorded by Queen and co-producer Roy Thomas Baker at five studios between August and September 1975. Due to recording logistics of the era, the band had to bounce the tracks across eight generations of 24-track tape, meaning that they required nearly 200 tracks for overdubs. The song parodies elements of opera with bombastic choruses, sarcastic recitative, and distorted Italian operatic phrases. Lyrical references include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, and Beelzebub, with cries of "Bismillah!" Although critical reaction was initially mixed, "Bohemian Rhapsody" became regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of all time, as well as Queen's most popular. The promotional video is credited with furthering the development of the music video medium. It has appeared in numerous polls of the greatest songs in popular music, including a ranking at number 17 on Rolling Stone's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. A Rolling Stone readers' poll ranked Mercury's vocal performance as the greatest in rock history. "Bohemian Rhapsody" topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks (plus another five weeks following Mercury's 1991 death) and remains the UK's third best-selling single of all time. It also topped the charts in countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and sold over six million copies worldwide. In the United States, the song peaked at number nine in 1976, but reached a new peak of number two after appearing in the 1992 film Wayne's World. In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Following the release of the 2018 biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, it became the most streamed song from the 20th century. In 2021, it was certified Diamond in the US for combined digital sales and streams equal to 10 million units.

    Birthday is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez for her solo debut studio album Stars Dance (2013). It was written and produced by Mike Del Rio, with additional writing by Crista Russo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. Matt Beckley also provided additional vocal production for the song. Musically, Birthday combines deep electronic dance beats and police sirens with elements of trap music. The song's instrumentation is created by blending purring, synthesized bass, snappy beats, handclaps, "oxygen-sucking" sub-bass, and trap snares with sexual moans and elements of hip hop music. Sparse drum beats and vocal chants are woven throughout the song's composition, which has been described by critics as club-ready electropunk, with trap and dubstep elements. The song was originally announced as a single, but was never officially released from the album. Thematically, "Birthday" is a party song which discusses topics such as sex appeal, self-entitlement, and girl power, while its risqué lyrics speak of a night of hard partying. The song has received comparisons to the music of several artists, including Dev, M.I.A., and Icona Pop. Upon release, Birthday received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's unique sound and production. Upon the release of Stars Dance, the song charted at number 12 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. Birthday has charted at number 191 on the South Korea Gaon International Chart due to high digital downloads. An accompanying music video for the song was released on July 22, 2013, to coincide with Gomez's 21st birthday, and features the artist and her friends partying and singing the song in different locations, including an underground nightclub and a dark room.
